# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions in JavaScript

Welcome to my collection of **LeetCode problem solutions** written in **JavaScript**.  
This repository is organized to help track my progress and demonstrate different approaches for solving problems.

For each problem, I aim to provide:

- ✅ A **brute force / basic solution** – to explain the most straightforward logic.
- 🚀 An **optimized solution** – to improve efficiency in terms of time and/or space.
